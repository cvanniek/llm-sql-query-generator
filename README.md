# LLM SQL Query Generator

This project explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to convert natural language questions into SQL queries. We use structured datasets from NCAA basketball and the Oscars, and evaluate performance across varying query complexities.

## Project Goals

- Convert natural language to SQL using prompt-based approaches
- Evaluate model performance (e.g., GPT-3.5, Claude) across easy, medium, and hard query types
- Identify patterns in errors and suggest strategies for improvement

## Datasets

- NCAA Basketball Stats Dataset
- Oscars Awards History Dataset  
(Datasets were cleaned and structured for tabular querying)

## Model Evaluation

- Models Tested: Claude Instant
- Query Difficulty Levels: Easy, Medium, Hard
- Metrics: Execution accuracy, syntax correctness, model hallucination analysis
